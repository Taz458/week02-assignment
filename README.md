# week02-assignment

External Sources + things I had to research.

.firstchild gets the first child of the parent eleement. In this case I used it for displayElem.firstchild, as I needed a way to get the current img element inside the display container. (Used ChatGPT to explain how i'd access an image tag inside a div container using javascript.)

How to add a keyboard event listener, so that the user can click enter on the thumbnail image and select. (Used SheCodes.com and ChatGPT.)

How to get the image to cover the whole screen, which is object-fit: cover;. Found that using inspect element on the gallery demo, and chatGPT to explain and give examples.

Had to search some colours and do resarch on rgb, and semi transparent colours I could use.

I also stole some fade in animations for CSS to make the page smoother. i used the style.css of the gallery demo and chatGPT for some of my CSS.



ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
- All of the required goals, which were resposive design, images with alt texts and event handlers (addEventListners).
-Also, I added aria elements to the buttons, and media queries. Also, 

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
- The use of srcset, and keyboard shortcuts. Also, I made a scrollbar in CSS, but I believe I haven't added enough images so it overflows and is needed.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
-To be honest, it was just lack of time and energy, due to the amount of debugging and resarch I had to do over the weekend, after
learning so many new things and trying to implement it.

Final Thoughts:

I found this assignment quite challenging, but also very rewarding. So many little errors (whether in syntax or in logic) had me feeling lost and overwhelemed at times,
but with a lot of research, debugging myself and using chatGPT, alongside diving deep into the gallery demo, asking AI to take me step by step to see what each function did,
I was able to come to a much better understanding of the code and build a decent looking gallery!

I found adding loads of comments to help me look back and understand what I was doing helped alot, and helped me not to get lost in the code, so feel free to ignore the monstrosity of comments!
